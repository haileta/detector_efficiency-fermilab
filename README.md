The  Tag&Probe  (T&P)  method  is  an  experimental  procedure  used  commonly  in 
particle  physics  that  allows  to  measure  process  efficiencies  directly  from  data,  therefore  not 
relying on the accuracy of simulations. An accurate model of true electron efficiency could be 
derived  using  a  binned  Tag  and  Probe  approach.  However,  this  method  has  its  own  flaws, 
namely:  the  curse  of  dimensionality  makes  it  challenging  to  estimate  the  efficiency  in  a 
high-dimensional binning; each bin in the probe kinematics needs to separately be validated; 
and the binned efficiency estimates do not capture the expected smooth structure of the true 
efficiency.  We  propose  to  develop  an  unbinned  efficiency  measurement,  and  compare  its 
performance with the classic binned T&P approach on CMS Open Data. The method relies upon 
Z  â†’  di-electron  decays  to  provide  an  unbiased,  high-purity,  electron  sample  with  which  to 
measure the efficiency of a particular selection or trigger.
